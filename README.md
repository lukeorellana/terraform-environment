# terraform-environment

This repo contains a containerized environment for Terraform development. The `.devcontainer` folder can be copied to other repositories and used within [Github Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) or with the [Remote Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) VSCode extension. This example is meant to be used as a starting point. Feel free to copy and modify to automate your own personal environment.
